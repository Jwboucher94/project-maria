First project for Comp Sci Data Structures. </br>
Simply a python program involving csv, urllib, and BeautifulSoup to extract the Names, Ranks, Degrees, and Institutions of the Suffolk University Faculty. Many bad coding issues in the website led to myself getting frustrated over trying to bypass simple things, but I seemed to have been successful in the end. Included is the program file, the csv containing the data, and a cached copy of the faculty list site.
